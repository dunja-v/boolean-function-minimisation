# Boolean function minimisation

Educational application created to help sudents better understand the Boolean function minimisation process using the Quine-McCluskey method. 

The application eanbles the user to input an arbitrary Boolean function with up to four variables. It then provides all the implicants for the given function. The user may select any number of implicants. For the selected implicants, the application draws K-tables and a shema of logic circuits. 

The user may simulate the work of the logic circuits with the given input values. The delays may also be set for the circuits in order show hazards.
